——— GAME CONCEPT ———

Teeny Weeny Wizard is a puzzle-adventure platformer where you’ve accidentally shrunk yourself while practicing spells, and now the tiny creatures you captured have escaped! Use your magical telekinesis powers to platform, solve puzzles and fight your way to your spell book to undo the spell and no longer be “teeny weeny” again!

——— HOW TO PLAY/SOLVE TEENY WEENY WIZARD ———
===== MAIN MENU =====
1. Run the game executable, Teeny Weeny Wizard.exe.
2. Upon launch, you will see the game's start screen. You may click "Start" to start playing the game, or click "Quit" to leave the game. For now, press "Start".

===== LEVEL =====
3. The player starts under a pile of books. Walk towards the "opening" of the pile of books. 
4. You may try picking up a card. You will reach a small cabinet with a preset card in the gaps, and another white bookmark indicator in it. Throw the card into the empty white bookmark to slot the card into the cabinet.
5. Climb up the small cabinet. You will reach a purple gemstone upon landing on the upper floor. This acts as a checkpoint in the case that the player wishes to respawn to their last checkpoint.
6. There will be 3 enemy slimes in front of you. Each slime has consumed a card each. You may use the glass shards that broke across the floor to throw it at the patrolling slime to deal damage to it. Otherwise, when coming in contact, it will attempt to deal damage to you as well. If the slime is killed, it will drop the card it is holding.
7. Beside you are a stack of books with bookmarks sticking out. Pick up the cards that was dropped and aim it at the bookmarks to stick it in between the books.
8. Platform up the stack of books using the cards as platforms.
9. After reaching the top, head on over to the table to save your next checkpoint. You will see a hanging tray. Pick up the glass shards to cut the rope, so that the tray will drop, and you will be able to use the tray as a slope to walk up the shelf.
10. Walk across and cut the 2nd hanging tray.
11. Upon reaching the fallen bookcase, there will be two more slimes, red in color. These slimes have higher HP, deal more damage to you, but moves slower as well. Similarly, use the glass shards to attack the slimes.
12. Cut the 3rd hanging tray to reach the last location of the level, The Table.
13. Upon reaching the table, the moment you walk onto the red cloth, you will start your battle with The Quill. You will not be able to exit the battle.
14. Use the glass shards to deal damage to the quill as well. The quill has even more HP, deals more damage, and due to the close proximity, will deal more damage to you.
15. Upon killing the quill, you will reach the end of the level/gameplay for this M2 submission! Feel free to continue looking at the 3D props in the game.

——— KNOWN BUGS (TO BE FIXED) ———
1. Fall Damage Bug (Inconsistent) : When the player falls from a high height, it will take fall damage. However, when the player jumps normally, it will take fall damage again.
SOLUTION: Respawn/Restart.
